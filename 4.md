# CAPTAIN: High-Level Design Document

## 1. System Overview

CAPTAIN (Comprehensive AI-Powered Tracking And INtegration) is an AI-driven job application management system. It assists users in managing their job search process, from resume creation to application tracking and interview preparation.

### 1.1 Key Components

1. **User Interface (Gradio)**
    - Resume Tab
    - Job Applications Tab
    - Captain's Overview Tab
2. **AI Engine (LangChain)**
    - Resume Analysis and Improvement
    - Job Opportunity Analysis
    - Application Strategy Generation
    - Interview Simulation
3. **Data Management**
    - Context Manager
    - Data Persistence

## 2. Architecture

CAPTAIN follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
[User] <-> [Gradio UI] <-> [Core Logic] <-> [AI Components] <-> [LangChain/OpenAI]
                               ^
                               |
                        [Data Management]

```

### 2.1 Key Modules

- `ui/`: Gradio interface components
- `core/`: Central logic and data management
- `ai/`: AI-powered analysis and generation components
- `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities

## 3. Data Flow

1. User interacts with Gradio UI
2. UI triggers core logic functions
3. Core logic interacts with AI components as needed
4. AI components use LangChain to generate responses
5. Results are passed back through core logic to UI
6. UI updates to display results to user

## 4. Key Features

1. **Intelligent Resume Management**
    - AI-powered resume analysis and improvement suggestions
    - Version control and rollback capabilities
2. **Dynamic Job Application Tracking**
    - Automated job description analysis
    - Application status tracking with AI-generated insights
3. **AI Career Assistant (Captain)**
    - Overall job search strategy recommendations
    - Personalized weekend project suggestions
    - First-day-at-work simulations
4. **Interview Preparation**
    - AI-generated potential interview questions and answers
    - Company culture analysis

## 5. User Experience

### 5.1 User Journey

1. **Onboarding**
    - User uploads or creates their initial resume
    - AI provides initial analysis and improvement suggestions
2. **Job Application Process**
    - User adds new job opportunities
    - System analyzes job descriptions and suggests resume tailoring
    - User updates application statuses as they progress
3. **Ongoing Support**
    - Captain provides regular job search overviews and suggestions
    - User receives personalized weekend project ideas
    - System offers interview preparation support as needed

### 5.2 UI Design Principles

- **Simplicity**: Clear, intuitive interface with three main tabs
- **Guidance**: AI-powered suggestions throughout the process
- **Flexibility**: Allow users to accept, modify, or ignore AI suggestions
- **Transparency**: Clearly indicate AI-generated content vs. user input

### 5.3 Key Interactions

- Resume editing and version control
- Adding and updating job applications
- Requesting and viewing AI-generated insights
- Simulating interviews and first-day experiences

## 6. AI Integration

### 6.1 LangChain Usage

- Utilize LangChain for structured prompts and consistent AI interactions
- Leverage LangChain's memory capabilities for context-aware responses

### 6.2 Key AI Functionalities

- Resume analysis and improvement
- Job description analysis and matching
- Application strategy generation
- Interview question generation and simulation

## 7. Data Management

### 7.1 Data Models

- Resume (content, version history, AI suggestions)
- Job Applications (company, position, status, notes)
- User Profile (career goals, skills, preferences)

### 7.2 Persistence

- Regular auto-saving of user data
- Option for users to manually save and load progress

## 8. Scalability and Performance

- Modular design allows for easy addition of new features
- Potential for multi-user support in future versions
- Asynchronous AI operations to maintain UI responsiveness

## 9. Security Considerations

- Secure handling of user data and job application information
- API key management for AI services
- Regular security audits and updates

## 10. Future Enhancements

- Integration with job boards for automatic job discovery
- Advanced analytics dashboard for job search insights
- Mobile app for on-the-go job search management

## 11. Development Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use type hints for improved code readability and maintainability
- Write unit tests for all AI components and core logic functions
- Maintain comprehensive documentation, including docstrings

## 12. Deployment

- Use virtual environments for dependency management
- Containerize the application for easy deployment and scaling
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
