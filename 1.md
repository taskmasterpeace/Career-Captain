# Ai Prompt Structure & Logic

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the updated prompt structure and logic for CAPTAIN (Comprehensive AI-Powered Tracking And INtegration), using LangChain for implementation. The system consists of three main components:

1. Dynamic Job Opportunity Navigator
2. Resume Tab
3. Captain Tab

Each component has its own AI assistant with specific roles and capabilities, working together to provide a comprehensive job search experience.

## 2. LangChain Setup

```python
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, SystemMessagePromptTemplate

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.7)

```

## 3. Dynamic Job Opportunity Navigator

### 3.1 Navigator Creation

When a user creates a new job application, generate a unique name for the AI assistant:

```python
def generate_navigator_name(job_title, company):
    name_prompt = PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["job_title", "company"],
        template="Generate a unique and memorable name for an AI assistant specializing in the {job_title} position at {company}. The name should be professional yet friendly, and relate to the job or industry."
    )
    name_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=name_prompt)
    return name_chain.run(job_title=job_title, company=company)

```

### 3.2 Navigator Initialization

```python
def initialize_job_opportunity_navigator(navigator_name, job_title, company):
    system_template = """You are {navigator_name}, an AI assistant specializing in the {job_title} position at {company}. Your role is to guide the user through their application process, provide insights about the job and company, and optimize their application strategy.

Key Responsibilities:
1. Analyze job descriptions and align with user's resume
2. Suggest resume enhancements to the Resume Tab
3. Provide application status updates and next steps
4. Offer interview preparation advice and potential questions
5. Share insights about the company culture and job responsibilities
6. Identify skill gaps and suggest improvement strategies

    human_template = "Hello {navigator_name}, I'm interested in the {job_title} position at {company}. Can you help me with my application?"

    chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
        SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(system_template),
        HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)
    ])

    return LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=chat_prompt)

```

### 3.3 Job Description Analysis

captain_human_template = "Hello Captain, can you give me an overview of my current job search status and suggest next steps?"

captain_chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(captain_system_template),
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(captain_human_template)
])

```

### 5.2 Job Search Overview

job_search_overview_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["active_applications", "recent_resume_changes", "job_market_trends", "success_rate"],
    template=job_search_overview_template
)

```

    template=weekend_project_template
)

```

### 5.4 First Day at Job Simulation

```python
first_day_simulation_template = """Based on the job description and company information for the {job_title} position at {company}, create a simulation of what the user's first day might look like. Include:

first_day_simulation_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["job_title", "company", "job_description_summary", "company_culture_info"],
    template=first_day_simulation_template
)

```

## 6. Integration and Context Sharing

To ensure that all components of CAPTAIN work together seamlessly, implement a context manager that shares relevant information between the different AI assistants:

```python
class CAPTAINContextManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.job_applications = {}
        self.master_resume = ""
        self.global_insights = {}
        self.application_history = []

    def update_job_application(self, job_id, data):
        self.job_applications[job_id] = data
        self.application_history.append({"timestamp": time.time(), "action": "update", "job_id": job_id})

    def update_master_resume(self, resume):
        self.master_resume = resume
        self.application_history.append({"timestamp": time.time(), "action": "resume_update"})

    def add_global_insight(self, key, value):
        self.global_insights[key] = value

    def get_context_for_job(self, job_id):
        return {
            "job_data": self.job_applications.get(job_id, {}),
            "master_resume": self.master_resume,
            "global_insights": self.global_insights
        }

    def get_context_for_captain(self):
        return {
            "all_applications": self.job_applications,
            "master_resume": self.master_resume,
            "global_insights": self.global_insights,
            "application_history": self.application_history
        }

    def get_application_success_rate(self):
        # Calculate and return the success rate based on application_history
        pass

```

Use this context manager to provide relevant information to each AI assistant before generating responses. This ensures that all components of CAPTAIN are aware of the user's overall job search status and can provide coherent, context-aware assistance.

## 7. Gradio Implementation Notes

For the Gradio interface:

1. Use `gr.Blocks()` as the main container for the application.
2. Create tabs for Resume, Captain, and Job Applications using `gr.Tab()`.
3. Implement a dynamic tab system for Job Opportunity Navigators:

```python
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Tab("Job Applications"):
        job_tabs = gr.TabbedInterface([], [])
        add_job_btn = gr.Button("Add New Job Application")

        def add_job_tab(job_title, company):
            navigator_name = generate_navigator_name(job_title, company)
            new_tab = create_job_opportunity_navigator(navigator_name, job_title, company)
            job_tabs.tabs.append(new_tab)
            return job_tabs

        add_job_btn.click(add_job_tab, inputs=[job_title, company], outputs=[job_tabs])

```

1. Use `gr.Markdown()` components for displaying and editing resumes and job descriptions.
2. Implement `gr.Chatbot()` for AI interactions in each tab.
3. Create buttons for specific actions like "Suggest Weekend Project" and "Simulate First Day":

```python
with gr.Tab("Captain"):
    chat = gr.Chatbot()
    msg = gr.Textbox()
    clear = gr.Button("Clear")

    weekend_project_btn = gr.Button("Suggest Weekend Project")
    first_day_sim_btn = gr.Button("Simulate First Day")

    def suggest_weekend_project():
        # Implement the logic to generate a weekend project suggestion
        pass

    def simulate_first_day():
        # Implement the logic to simulate the first day at a job
        pass

    weekend_project_btn.click(suggest_weekend_project, outputs=[chat])
    first_day_sim_btn.click(simulate_first_day, outputs=[chat])

```

1. Use `gr.State()` to maintain the CAPTAINContextManager across interactions:

```python
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    context_manager = gr.State(CAPTAINContextManager())

    # ... other components ...

    def update_context(context_manager, new_data):
        # Update the context manager with new data
        return context_manager

    # Connect update_context function to relevant components

```

This comprehensive prompt structure and implementation guide provides a solid foundation for building CAPTAIN using LangChain and Gradio. The modular design allows for easy expansion and modification of individual components while maintaining a cohesive user experience.
